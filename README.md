[Cribbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cribbage) is a popular card game, predominately played by two players.

This project was developed as a learning exercise, using Cribbage as the example domain. The original aim was to bed down:

  - [Akka](https://akka.io/) and its related libraries
  - [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) - Command Query Responsibility Segregation
  - [Domain Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/tags/domain%20driven%20design.html) 
  - [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html), and
  - [Event Storming](https://www.eventstorming.com/)

Over time my interest in pure functional programs has been piqued, so I'll be looking into [Cats Effects](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) stack. As of Jan 2023, this is still under development.
